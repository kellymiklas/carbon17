See-Security is an eye tracking form of authentication. Using WebGazer, an eye tracking library, patrons can prove their identity by moving their eyes in a secret pattern that only they know. This pattern is determined when the user first sets up their device. See-Security offers a unique factor of authentication that is both inconspicuous and local. Additionally, WebGazer.js runs completely in the client browser, sending no video data to a server.

Setup:

git clone 
in MAMP - Preferences > Web Server
Set Document Root to See Security folder
MAMP > Start Servers
run on localhost:8888
